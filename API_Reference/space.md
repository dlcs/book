# Space

Spaces allow you to partition images into groups. You can use them to organise your images logically, like folders.

You can also define different default settings to apply to images registered in a space. For example, default access control behaviour for all images in a space, or default tags. These can be overridden for individual images.

There is no limit to the number of images you can register in a space.
