# The DLCS Pilot

The Wellcome Library would like to invite any cultural heritage organisation- which has digitised content â€“ to participate in the Digital Library Cloud Services (DLCS) pilot.

Participants will be able to use the DLCS to generate IIIF endpoints for all images, make use of cloud based infrastructure to store and deliver those images and explore how the DLCS could be integrated into their own discovery platforms.
